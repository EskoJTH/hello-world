*WEAPON ROOM*
There is a poleweapon on the room wall. \n
It has a lot of spikes and hooks to all directions in its blade end. \n
That is one of the most usual weapons you know. \n
Very effective when used together in a group and not too bad when alone either. \n
Extremely good if you want to hook enemys weapon.\n
There also is an old light crossbow. \n
It would be useless against platemail the one you used to have. \n
They have broad heads designed for hunting.

Tt tells of how world was when the great old ones ruled. \n

*KEYROOM*
In this room there is a giant weirdly shaped metal tetrahedron -ish thing in the middle of the room.

Look...metal thing/tetrahedron/thing
You take a closer inspection on the object. You are absolutely sure it is a tetrahedron but it defenitely has more verticies and edges than a tetrahedron is alloved to. You can't get it to fit into your perception of euclidean physics. You get a headache and give up trying to make sense out of it. You think you could carry that thing but it would take a lot of time and both of your hands.

There is a scabbard of a sword here. \n
You quickly notice this room has been used for handling of meat. \n
You find some very smoothly shredded meat laying around. \n
There are a lot of weird devices with writing in languages foreign to you. \n
Shapes so complex but at the same time simple that they could have never been created by any human. \n
Things bend out of glass and metal like nothing you have ever seen before with self illumination. \n
There is a cursed black plate to the corner that is smoking and appears hot as flames.

*NEST*
There is a nest of some form here. \n
It is made of hairs and some pieces of wood and other common things you have seen in this maze. \n
There is some sort of evil presence all around it and the stench is burning your noce.

There is a giant stone square on the wall with stairs leading through it. \n
The circle is surrounded by symbols in unkown languages.

Go.. Circle

The hole is surrounded by disks filled with symbols of unknown origin.
